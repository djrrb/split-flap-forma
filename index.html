        <p>Originally released in 1968, Forma was the Italian type foundry Nebiolo’s answer to Helvetica. It was created by a team of eight designers, led by the legendary Aldo Novarese, that Nebiolo assembled to design a more mature and humane neo-grotesque. As a result, Forma’s rationality is tempered by its warmth, and its trademark single-story a sets it apart from the rest.
        </p>
        <p>Issued in metal over a decade after Helvetica and Univers, Forma was relatively late to the neutral sans serif game. It never made the jump to phototypesetting and virtually disappeared after Nebiolo closed its doors in 1978. However, publications designer Roger Black always continued to admire the design, and in 2013 asked me to revive it for his redesign of Hong Kong Tatler magazine.</p>

        <p>Forma DJR embodies the peculiar collision of midcentury modernist precision and the smudgy realities of metal, ink, and paper. This revival is not based on Forma’s original drawings, nor does it try to truly capture its designers’ original intent. Instead it brings new life to a bygone typographic era, and seeks to recapture everything that Roger has loved about Forma for so long. 
        </p>
        <p>Expert type hunter Indra Kupferschmid obtained a casting of the original Forma in lead, and printed fresh proofs for us to use as source material for our revival. We found that many of the most interesting details were not present in Forma’s original drawings, but were instead byproducts of the printing process. Stems that were supposed to be straight swelled at either end. Corners that were supposed to be sharp were rounded. We believe that Forma comes alive in these unintentional details, and worked to incorporate subtle bits of unevenness into our digital interpretation.
